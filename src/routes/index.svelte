            <p>Even though a traditional local business keeps money and jobs in Rhode Island, its top-down structure means that the people at the top get most of the benefit.</p>
            <p>Cooperatives more fairly distribute profits and responsibilities. They also tend to be more sustainable, so money invested in them has a better chance of getting paid back.</p>
